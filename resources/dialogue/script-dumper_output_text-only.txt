So, now it's the time to show you the way of the Starstorm...
For a while, you must live far away from your friends and live with me.
Do you understand?
...There's only one answer.
I must stop you here even if you don't want to.
Stay with me for a while, do you understand?!
It depends onBe faithful, and wait until the time comes!Npc1148:
I'm doing this as a hobby.
I recently made a friend.
And now he's aDungeon Man.

Would you like to meet him?
I understand,
All righty then, I'll give you the key so that you can enter him.
Oh no... I don't have it!
I must have lost it somewhere.
I'm sorry, I don't worry about small things.
I stayed here the whole time you were gone.
But now I don't know why I did.Npc1149:
I am not sure if it was theDungeon Man,
but...
there is a strange looking tower to the northwest.
...This key I picked up a little while ago shall maybe open the tower.
You may have it, I do not need it.
I'm not sure if it was theDungeon Man
...
There's a strange looking tower to the northwest.
...But it seems that you have too many things.Npc1150:
(Looks like you could enter, but it's locked.)
(The key worked to open the door.
You may enter.)
(The key doesn't fit!)
(The door's already opened.)Npc1151:
A scary place called Deep Darkness is on the other side of the river.
The monsters are very strong and you can lose your health
just by wandering in the swamp.
Do you want to cross the river,
It was stupid of me to ask.
Let's watch the sunset over Deep Darkness together from here.
The swamp is bottomless.
Even if you're swimming, you'll be dragged in.
It is a different story if you have a submarine.
You returned from exploring the Deep Darkness?
I cannot believe you made it back alive.Npc1196:
Welcome!
Long time, no see.
Mr.I'm Brick Road.
Dr. Andonuts finally made me Dungeon Man.
If you want, I'll come with you guys for a while.
TheReturn Hole
is over there.
Jump in that hole and then walk out.
There's an old submarine at the back of the dungeon.
It can be used to cross the river.
There's aGoodbye Exit
...over there.
It will take you to the submarine.
Don't make a mistake on which exit you take.
You need to take theGoodbye Exit!

I don't know how, but my homemade dungeon helped you out.
I'm glad.Npc1219:

Goodbye Exit

Some day, you should enter with courage.
...Brick Road.
This path is closed.
...Brick Road.Npc1200:Npc1204:Npc1209:Npc1210:

Good Night Bench.

May you relax and recover your health and spirits.
's health is restored.Npc1197:

Yes!
(No one can repair the submarine except Npc1155:
Oh, be careful where you walk.  It's filthy.
A chubby kid did his business out here somewhere...Npc1162:

You need to be able to read hieroglyphs to solve the mystery of the Pyramid.
...I couldn't solve it, although I read it.
Didn't you read the hieroglyphs at the museum in Summers?
Well, that means that you must go back, read it and then come back here.
Then, you should be able to solve the mystery somehow.Npc1165:
Hassan's Shop
($ dollars acceptable.)Npc1221:
That face is mine.
...Brick Road.

It's me, Pokey.
I assist only the strong and able!
That's Pokey.
You guys look pathetic!
The Apple of Enlightenment has already made a prediction.
...But I won't let what the Apple of Enlightenment predicted take place.
You guys will be beaten by Giygas.
Giygas will be stronger, a more powerful entity than any other!
Why?
'Cause of me.
I was led by Giygas, and now I'm here.
The Apple of Enlightenment couldn't predict this.
Master Giygas.
He has become the embodiment of Evil itself...
which he cannot control on his own.
He is the Evil Power.

Do you hear a buzzing that sounds like a bee flying around?Oh, c'mon...
Yes!  You can hear it!
A bee.am

I'm from 10 years in the future.
And,
in the future,
Giygas, the universal cosmic destroyer,
sent all to the horror of eternal darkness...
.....
However,
Where I am from,
there is a well-known legend that has been handed down from ancient times.
It saysWhen the chosen boy reaches the point,
The passing of time will shatter the nightmare rock
and will reveal the path of light.

You see,
This I believe...
.....
Giygas' monstrous plan must have been set in motion somewhere on Earth...
If you start to confront the enemy immediately,
you may have time to counter the evil intentions of Giygas.
Three things are of the utmost importance:
...The legends from the ancient times tell of three boys and a girl
who defeat Giygas.
...I will tell you more later.
Go now!
You have much work to do,Did you listen to what I told you?I hate to go over it again,
We'll be here 'til sunrise!
Thank you for listening to my long story.
You are as exceptional as I expected you to be...
Buzz Buzz now joins you.

It looks like you're really in a lot of trouble this time...
Three boys,
I'm not one of those three, am I?...
...'Cause... I'm not into this kind of thing at all...
Geez.Npc0044:
I'm really sorry that my kids troubled you so much...
Both of you are really going to get it now!
By the way, I would be happy if you left sometime soon.
I'm tired of your family living next door.
We've loaned your father a lot of money.
It may have been a hundred thousand dollars or more...
Well, I guess it really could have been less,
but because of the loan,
My husband is much too lenient with the children.
Oh well,
Aya
I think it's a dung beetle!
*Sigh*Npc0046:
Agh!  I was...
...much weaker than I thought...
So you must now begin your adventure...
see...
you...
Oh,
Listen to my final words...
To defeat Giygas, your own power must unite with the Earth's...
the Earth will then channel your power and multiply it...
There are eight points that you must visit.
Each of these locations isYour Sanctuary.

One of them is near Onett.
Go there first...
Do you understand?...I see.
I apologize.
All right.
You are a very intelligent young man...
Oh!
urgh!...
Before I pass on,
It is the Sound Stone.
You can record the melodies from the eightYour Sanctuary
locations
into this stone.
By the way...
but did you want to hear the story one more time?Good!
It's already dawn outside...
But it doesn't matter to me.
Argh!
Oh,
What the...?
It seems that you have too many things to carry already...
Since you can't take it,
In the blink of an eye,
Ee

It's already dawn outside...
but it doesn't matter to me.
Be quiet!!  Don't get so upset!

It...  seems...  to be quite a powerful spot.
Some kind of special power is stored there
that allows certain people to perform wondrous feats.
However... a monster sucked up all the energy at that spot.
It's difficult to get to Giant Step.
I suggest you collect more information on your own.
The entrance to the path leading to Giant Step is

From now on,

They'll definitely make trouble during your adventure!

But I drove a car down the Jersey Turnpike at 80 mph.

It seems like every bakery has been making lucky sandwiches these days.
They're kind of like fortune cookies, except you can win stuff.
Oh yeah, and it's a sandwich.
Okay, so maybe it's not like a fortune cookie.
Anyway, the best thing that can happen isrecover PP.

I just wish I knew whatPP

The information on the back of therefreshing herb

Do you see the window showing HP and PP at the bottom of the screen?
When you go to a store that has equippable items,
this window will either flash, look normal or become black.
If you are allowed to equip an item, and it is stronger than your current item,
the window will flash.
If the item's power is equal to, or less than your current equipped item,
the window looks normal.
If you can't equip an item, the window is black.

Now it's time to become a regular dog again...)

Woof!Npc0107:
I'm cramming for the big test tomorrow.
It's about games.

Hotel Rule
...if you stay at a hotel, you'll wake up with full HP and PP.

Life Recovery Rule

...recovering your life will give you full HP, but zero PP.
...Hmmm... I bet this stuff will be on the test...Npc0104:
I recently read a book titledOur Convenient Society.

It said that our modern society demands
that there always be an ATM in hotels and drugstores.
Just knowing that is convenient!
I'm glad I read the book...
I can't believe I didn't know this stuff.
I'll check whether or not we have an ATM in our drugstore...Npc0102:
I read the book calledOur Society is Convenient.

It said that these days, there are always telephones in hotels and drugstores.
I also learned that to use a green pay phone costs a dollar,
while the black phones are free.
If you weren't aware of this,
all your money could get eaten up by your phone calls.
I'm glad I read that book...Npc0109:
I can't believe I saw it with my own eyes.
I was staring out the window and there it was, just fluttering there...
I'd only seen it in the encyclopedia before.
What was it?
A Magic butterfly!
If you get close to a Magic butterfly, all your cares fly away,
just like a fluttering butterfly.
Yep, yep!
That's the effect of the legendary Magic butterfly.
I love talking about it!
Ooops!
Sorry about the outburst...
I got carried away with all the talk about lovely butterflies...Npc0130:
(I am not your enemy.
I am simply your average run-of-the-mill mole.
Would you like some hints on fighting enemies?)
(Ah, I see...
You've already got a good grasp of how to fight effectively.)
(Listen carefully.
My hint involves which way you are facing when a battle with an enemy occurs.
If you allow enemies to approach you from your back or side,
they may get a surprise opening attack.
When they approach you this way, your TV screen, no... no...
I mean the world in front of you will show a red swirl for a second.
On the other hand, if you approach an enemy from the back or side,
you may get a surprise opening attack.
In that case, your TV...  Oops again!
...The world in front of you shows a green swirl.
The point is, try to fight so that you always have the advantage.)Npc0427:
(I am not your enemy.
I am just a plain ol' mole.
You are certainly stronger than you were while wandering around Onett.
Have you ever suddenly gotten theYou Won
message
when you met a weak enemy?
That's sure-fire proof that you've become stronger.
You don't want to waste your time fighting wimpy enemies, do you?)Npc0112:
Hello... and you are...?
Say, have you ever suffered from some type of sickness or condition
that you couldn't get cured at a hospital?
For example, beingDiamondized,

where your head gets as hard as a diamond...
Or...Mushroomized,
where you have a mushroom on your head...
If you're ever stuck with these types of embarrassing conditions,
we of the magic healing shrine are here to ease your pain.
We're ready and waiting...
in the lobby of hospitals all over the world.
The person next to me is the great teacher of magic healing.Npc1099:
I wish I could recover my PP just by drinking water...
Even though I have never seen him before, I heard that the prince can do that.
I guess I need more training...
By the way, just what is PP anyway?...Npc0342:
I came to buy condiments...
I wonder what would be good...
The right condiment makes a dish taste better,
while the wrong one makes it taste worse.
If the condiment matches the food,
you will get more power than if you ate the food item plain.Npc0097:
I live rent-free in the mouse's house.
The mice are known asExit mice.

They are very kind, and boy are they fast!
I really love these guys!Npc0301:
I always feel much better after hearing my mom's voice over the phone.
I was really homesick recently, and my mom cheered me right up.
You should call your mom sometime.
Believe me, those melancholy feelings will be gone before you know it.Npc0285:
I have a lot of old, broken junk, but I hate to throw anything away.
If you have a friend who is knowledgeable about mechanics,
that person might be able to fix something for you overnight...
Man, a friend like that would be so handy...Npc0007:
When you buy an item that should be equipped,
do you bother to actually equip it?
Heh eh, I gave a hint to my own enemy...
I'm such a rockin' dude!
I obviously have total confidence in my own abilities.
So... are you ready to get it on, Spanky?

Tessie is emerging!
I finally saw Tessie!
It's like seeing a UFO.
It emerged from the lake and flew toward Stonehenge.

I'm so glad I finally saw it.
I'm so happy, it brings tears to my eyes and makes my nose run.
Boo hoo hoo.Npc0628:

Take it from me,Npc0463:
(There's no response.)Npc0658:
I expected there to be about a seven percent chance that you would rescue me.
I just thought it was a good opportunity to meet Mr. Saturn.
I also got to meet Dr. Andonuts...
What?
You're looking for the bookOvercoming Shyness
?
I returned it to the Onett library.
Please use the book to help the shy Tenda tribe.
...Anyway,
I was kidnapped by some of Giygas' toadies!Npc0660:
Rescued.

I was scared, but I knew I'd be saved if I courageously
just sat here and waited long enough...
That's what I thought, but I began to lose hope...
I'm so glad you saved me after all.Npc0665:
I was kidnapped while milkin' a cow on m' farm.
I didn't think they'd git a ransom by kidnappin' little ol' me.Npc0666:
This is the happiest moment of my life.
No matter what happens I will live, live, live ten thousand years.
Thanks for all that you've done.Npc0635:
I heard that the wind is always blowing when Tessie appears.
Ahh Choo!
I feel like I'm catching a cold.
Boo hoo hoo.  Te Te Te Tessie!
I'm fogging up my binoculars!  Boo hoo hoo!
I wonder what Tessie thinks of me?
Sebastian, chum,Npc0636:
Tessie may unexpectedly be living in the woods.
I personally think so.
Tessie appeared again today and smiled at me.
...It's so shocking...Npc0600:
I heard a creature called Tessie lives in the southern lake...
I don't believe it!Npc0601:
I heard a more interesting story than the rumor about Tessie.
It's about the Cave Boys at Stonehenge.
Many claim to have actually seen them.Npc0602:
I wonder if the rumor is true
that the center of Stonehenge has an entrance leading someplace.
Some day, we should check it out.Npc0603:
I'm sleepy.
I'll wash my face, brush my teeth, do my business, and go to bed.Npc0604:
If you're going outside,
He always looks out for the younger students.
Maxwell is still working hard in the lab downstairs.
Anyway, these days there are many dangerous animals wandering around outside.Npc0624:
The tame animals have become wild.
Outside there are many monsters I've never seen before...
I wonder what's happening.
You should stay here where it's safe.Npc0625:
So, why don't you rest here for a short while...
perhaps some tea?Are you feeling much better now?
Are you feeling much better now?
There's something...
south of the lake...
it looks like a research building.
It is of course, some sort of lab where they do some high-level scientific research.
I get the feeling that it is a very important lab.Npc0616:
I've been waiting for you.
My master, Apple Kid completed thisEraser Eraser Machine.

While he was calling you, he was kidnapped.
I was there, but was helpless.
Anyway, take this machine.
I think this is an important item.
Get rid of something you don't need, and come back for it.
Way to go.
I've been taking care of this place while waiting for you.
I no longer need to stay, since you have arrived...
I'll leave for Saturn Valley as quiet as a mouse.Npc0733:

No, no!
This band owes me a million bucks.
If they break their contract,
The police would probably say,
Unless you're able to pay a million dollars on their behalf?
You'd have to find buried gold,
or you would never be able to pay such a huge sum of money.

A lot has happened to me.
I have to try and sort it all out... thinking is tough for me.Npc0863:

The Mani Mani Statue creates an illusion.
It attracts evil spirits and weakens your heart.

I often went there to pray.

Cryptic words appeared to me while I was in the illusion.

Anyway, the evil side would be in trouble if you visit Summers...
Oh!  On the contrary, you should definitely go to Summers,
especially because they don't want you to make it there.

by those dang street punks called the Sharks.

They are great inventors ...to be.
They need some financial help.
If you help them ...later,

something wonderful will happen.

you will enter the Peaceful Rest Valley.
If you keep going east, you will come to Happy Happy Village.
You should maybe go there, unless you have something better to do?

Go back to the Peaceful Rest Valley.
Have you been to the Happy Happyism headquarters
at the center of Happy Happy village?
Do you want to go there?
Or not?
What?
Why can't you make up your mind!
Do you remember seeing a litte mountain cabin on the way

There must be a cave in the Happy Happy village that leads to that cabin.
This is my business, so I'm happy to have customers.

The Runaway Five, the band at the Chaos theater, is up to their eyes in debt.

There's a tunnel northwest of this town.
There are two guard zombies that hang out at the entrance.
They are actually pretty nice guys...
It might be a good idea to meet those guys...
But it's quite all right if you don't...
Though I think that you really ought to go there.
So, how are you doin', kid?
If you're tired, you should go to the hotel and rest.
Do you know about that mysterious tent that appeared
at the south end of town?
I don't know, but...  it looks kinda...  strange...

After you set the paper in a tent, go to the hotel and put your dogs up.

It seems like you don't know what to do in Saturn Valley.
The Mr. Saturn on the second floor of the cave should be able to tell you
a password to get you into the secret base.
Now that sounds like some handy info!
Mr. Saturn must have told you to wait for three minutes in front of the waterfall.
What?  You don't know where the waterfall is?
The waterfall is actually named Grapefruit Falls.
After you exit the tunnel that begins in the Threed graveyard,
go to the north.
You certainly know about the cave to Saturn Valley that is then on your right.
But...  You should not go in that cave.
Keep going straight north.
You'll eventually come to the Grapefruit Falls.
Then, wait patiently for three minutes.
Oh, you've forgotten to get something really important.
Be sure to check the garbage can that is left behind by the Boogey Tent.

do you know about the Dusty Dunes Desert?
You should head to the desert to look for buried treasure.
It would be fabulous if you found it!
Have you told the treasure hunter in the desert that you beat five bosses?
I used to be a businessman, and I can tell you from experience.
Reporting is crucial.
So, have you been out taking any walks lately?
Walking is great.
You know, it's not good for you
to always be riding the bus 'cause it's way too easy.
Walk down the road between Dusty Dunes Desert and Fourside.
Especially be sure to walk across the bridge.
There's nothing quite as exciting as walking across a bridge
when you don't know the train schedule...
It's such a pity...
The Runaway Five have managed to get stuck at the Topolla Theater
because of their debt problems.
Why don't you go and talk to Miss Fake, the manager of the theater?
That diamond you're carrying should come in handy.
The department store in Fourside has reopened after being renovated.
People say that they have a good variety of things,
but the prices are a little bit high.
Have you been there yet?
Well...  I'm not exactly sure, but it seems to me that...
the top floor of the department store is kind of suspicious...
Have you been to Jackie's Cafe?
It's not difficult to find... the sign saysCafe.

These days, young people seem to be so indifferent
to what's happening in the real world.
It's disappointing that you seem to be indifferent about the real world, too.
For example, if you see someone lying in the street,
don't you think that you should really stop and try to help him?
Did you go back to Jackie's Cafe?
There seems to be something mighty suspicious behind the counter...
The monkey...  got charred.
Is he all right?
You should be able to find something out at the Monkey Cave
in the Dusty Dunes Desert.
That's what I say... on to the desert!
The maid out front of the Monotoli Building
is waiting for theI heard that you were asked to dinner
by the cute maid at the Monotoli Building.
Lucky you!  I envy kids like you... but just a bit.
It was a while ago, but I heard that a silver flying contraption of some sortcrash landed in the graveyard in Threed.
In Winters, you've been to the cave north of Stonehenge, right?
I would bet it's one ofYour Sanctuary.

Do you remember that Dr. Andonuts had the sky runner?
What do you say to your going and giving it a whirl?
You need to make a reservation by phone to go to the Stoic Club.
Someone in Toto, the port town next to Summers,
should know the phone number.
Try placing a call to  the Strip... ooops!  sorry,  I mean the Stoic Club.
After you get into the Stoic Club,
be sure to talk to the man with the mustache at the back table.
This is a pretty important hint.
People say that there is a Magic cake vendor
on the pavement by the beach in the resort of Summers.
Oh yeah,Pavement
meanssidewalk.

Well, I was just testing you...
Are you angry?  I didn't mean it... sorry!
Scaraba Cultural Museum...
Scaraba Cultural Museum...
Scaraba Cultural Museum...
Did you go to the second floor of the Scaraba Cultural Museum in Summers?
If you are lucky... you'll get to see the hieroglyph.
...Yeah, you sure would be lucky.
If you want to sail across the ocean, who better than to ask but a sailor?
After you've made all the necessary preparations, go to the pyramid.
In front of the pyramid, as the writing on the hieroglyph told,
step on the round stone plates in front of the sphinx, and draw a star.
That was really too much info to give out as a hint, wasn't it?
Deep in the pyramid, there is an item called theYou shouldn't exit the pyramid unless you have  theI don't know if he's an enemy of yours or not, but
the guy calledDungeon Man
seems to be waiting for you.
Have you already met him before this?
There is a broken submarine in the Dungeon Man's tummy.
Once the submarine gets fixed, you can go to the Deep Darkness.
Uhhh... maybe...
If you need to brighten up a dark street you use...
Yep, that's right!  A flashlight!
Oh... you don't have one?  Actually, I knew that you didn't.
Well, what comes in handy is something that you, y'know,
picked up in, y'know, the pyramid...
I forgot the name...  It's that whatchyamacallit... ohhh... crud!
It's tough, but you have to keep pressing on through the Deep Darkness.
That way, you'll find the village of the Tenda.
Don't give up yet.
Apple...
Winters...
Andonuts...
The Pencil Eraser makes pencil-shaped stuff disappear.
What do you think the Eraser Eraser machine does?
It looks like Apple Kid is trapped deep, deep, deep in the Stonehenge enemy base.
Well, usually you find books at the library.
One who goes to the the fishmonger and expects
to find books is likely to get very embarrassed indeed.
To correct shyness, you should let that person read a self-help book.

Overcoming Shyness
is probably the best...  It was a best-seller, y'know.
If a whole group is shy, the leader of the group should read the book on shyness
to all the group members, and the whole group may get over shyness.
Though at least a part will certainly stop being shy.
So, how many times did I use the wordshy
?...
Oh, heeey!
Have you have you spoken with like, the Tenda
deep in the cute, little Tenda village?
Oh... my... gosh...  Really???
Are you like, really serious???
I sound like a y'know, teenage girl?
Do you like the way I talk now?
There is a very important place under the Tenda Village.
Do you know about the talking rock in the Lost Underworld?
You should listen to what the rock has to say and then put it into practice.
Do you know that talking rock in the Lost Underworld?
You should listen to what the rock has to say.
Maybe ...  where you should visit is
Saturn Valley...
A very special substance is necessary to complete the Phase Distorter.
You know, I wonder if the site in Onett
where the meteorite landed has something to do with this?
I say, go there and check out the site.
I have no more hints for you.
You've done such a good job to this point.
From here on out...
Trust your judgement, and also your luck.
Well, I want to thank you for all the times
that you used the hint shop.  It's been a while since I first saw you...
This is my final day in business.

Well, so long kid,  No, no... MasterSee you again,  if fate allows it.
At the Dinosaur Museum in Fourside...
A man called called Mr. Spoon has a heavy mustache...
If you want to meet Venus, you should go backstage at the Topolla Theater.
An autograph with a banana!  I mean,  A banana with an autograph!
You'd better get this to Mr. Spoon right away!
Heck, since the door to the sewer is open,
why not go all the way inside and look around?
I know the stink and the vermin could overpower you,
but it might make you tougher, too.
If you have the Carrot Key,you should go to Dalaam and give it to the bunny at Pink Cloud.
If you don't have the Carrot Key, you should go to Magnet Hill.
You should be able to find the Carrot Key there.
I'd love to give you a hint, but I can't think of even one.
I'm sorry.  I'll return your money.
Oh, you don't have any money.  Don't you understand?
This is how I make my living... I can't just give you a hint for free, kid. my dear.
Now wait a minute, youngster!
That's it for today.
Do you want to hear the hint once more?
This is a special service just for you...Npc0078:
There are lots of snakes and stray dogs around Onett.
Is the mayor going to let them just run around, doing whatever they want?
I'm here to protest!Npc0079:
I work for City Hall,
Let's keep this between you and me.Npc0080:
We don't have any openings for part-time employees at this time.Npc0081:
Did I tell you that I saw a Giant Ant one time at Giant Step?
...
Oh,Npc0082:
Some suspicious-looking kids are hanging out in the woods north of the library.
I wonder if they are members of the Sharks.
To stop the spread of the gang,
don't you think?
I've started a movement
that will stop all of the bad influences on the children of Onett.
I call it theFresh Breeze Movement.
Npc0083:
I'm really in a foul mood.
Why?
I think I'll just kick back for a while.
It just may take me a couple of hours to sign this paper. *snicker* *snort*Npc0084:
Is it a school holiday today?
Remember to brush your teeth before going to bed.
Have you been wetting your bed?Npc0085:
The Mayor's office is on the second floor.
You need an appointment before you visit.
I'm going to have to stop you if you try to see the Mayor.
Look.
Since you beat up the Sharks,
Mayor Pirkle is waiting for you.
You look like someone who's going to do something big.
What was I thinking--Npc0086:
Hey
You beat up the town bullies,
punched them out big time,
spit in their eyes,
Then you forced them to promise not to make any more trouble.
What?  You want a key to the touring entertainers' shack?
For someone as great as you,
However,
please don't ask me to take any responsibility.
I'll be able to avoid any responsibility, right?
I'm a very important man in these parts.
Do you think I'm important?
Look,
and a brat like you should realize when someone is trying to be nice.
You're such a smart kid...
Although it's small,
You seem to have too much to carry.
Get rid of some stuff you don't need,
Hey,
I'm so busy with my election that I don't have time to meet with you.
Oh,
I saw a picture in the international newspaper of someone who looks like you,
but there's no way it was you.
Maybe you'd like to study my city management techniques
so that you could become Mayor someday?  Wa ha ha!
Since I returned peace to the town of Onett I was re-elected Mayor.
Are you here to celebrate?   Don't be so shy!
Thanks a lot.
From this day forward...
I will dedicate my life *sniff* to peace in Onett... *boo hoo*Npc0087:
In the next election, please give a speech supporting Mayor Pirkle.
Hee hee hee.
Since way,
Pals basically.  Ya ha ha ha ha.Npc0089:
City Hall is to the east.Npc0090:
I moved here from the way,
In the next town, there is the... what is the name?
uh... Polar Star preschool.
The preschool is at
I wanted to see you, Npc0091:
When you're in trouble,
All righty then,
Why don't you get a hint from the next house?Npc0092:
Mr. Lier X. Agerate,
I heard he will only show it to you.
The hotel is located to the west.
I'm sad 'cause I only got this short message.Npc0093:
I wonder ifEarthBound
has been released yet.
Listen to this!Npc0098:
Hi!
Kids can borrow only maps at this library.
Do you want to borrow one?
A man without a map isn't popular with the girls.
Do you want one now?
Here's a map.
Onett isn't the only thing on the map.
All the info is there, except for the info that isn't there.
Pressing the X Button allows you to view the map at any time.
You know, the X Button... located near the top.  Ha ha ha.
I suggest you bring a map along, even if you have to give up something else.
You seem to be carrying many worthless items.
It's not necessary to return the map now.
Come back in the year 2001 to return it.
Please return our bookOvercoming Shyness
later!
That book's great!
...Finally,
You're such a good boy.Npc0099:
AtGiant Step
there's a monster guarding that spot from the outside world.
No one knows when the monster made Giant Step its territory.
I wonder if he's stronger than my wife...Npc0100:
.....       .....            .....
(A man of few words.
Oh,
It's another nice day.  What?
I've read it.
You should be able to find it on the bookcase.
Are you a friend ofHi!
I'd really love to sit down and chat with you someday.
I'll talk about my adventure,
and you can tell me about all of your mistakes.Npc0105:
.....
Shhh!
The truth is,
Since I'm in a library,Npc0103:
Recently,
or am I just dreaming?
These days have been peaceful.
I miss the UFO's and monsters,Npc0106:
.....
Quiet!
Shh!
You're too loud!Npc0108:
I'm researchingGiant Step.

It's located north and west of Onett.
I heard it possesses a special power!
Clap,
When I see you,Npc0110:Npc0113:Npc0114:
I heard that around here,Npc0118:
When I came to visit my friend at this hospital,
I somehow slipped and fell in the hallway.
So now I'm staying in the hospital too.
This could be the basis for a great, tragic tearjerker.Npc0119:
I'm doing this because I trust you.
First,
Ah!
That's all right.
I know you think I'm a big liar but maybe I'll surprise you!
I'm doing this because I trust you.
First,
Ah!
That's all right.
Someone like you should just hang around that dreamer Gerardo Montague.
You're being vain,Life is...
You just saved the Earth from a crisis...
...When I was younger I too saved the Earth many times.
I live a modest life.
Don't you think a real hero is someone like me?

Don't be such a snob!
When you grow up,
You might think me a fool but when I do a job,
I'm a
Ignore me for now if you want...Npc0120:
You've grown since I last saw you.
You're so cool!
I...
Well,
You know what I mean.
Aren't youHow could I tell?
You might have the feeling thatHi,I was considering moving to Beak's Point.
What do you think?
You're right.
Do you really agree?Npc0121:
I had a dream about you,
If the dream comes true,
After all,
Love!
I maybe wrong,
You...
During your trip,
...I'm jealous.
How did you find this hide out?
Npc0122:
I'll give you myI know you've wanted it for a long time.
It's the best cap for someone really brave like you.
Ah!
You should either sell or throw away some junk and come back.
I'd like to go on an adventure with you once I become a little stronger.
I'll give you myI knowPutting this cap on will make you stronger.

Maybe he didn't talk much about his friends.
Oh!

It'sWe'll laugh about it tomorrow.

Do you like it?

It meanschuckle.

My philosophy ispeace to all men

Really? You like it?Npc0125:
Hey,
I was too busy to investigate,
I'm a busy man,
HeyA meteorite fell down and went boom!
I was fine because I always eat garlic and work out to help make my body stronger.
However,
I also want to tell you...
I almost told you about my...
Uh,
I wrote the message myself.
That's my real job,
Why don't you check out my work?
Sigh.

Can you come visit me later,Npc0126:
Hey you,
What a rebellious kid!
So you just didn't want to read the sign, huh kid...
Get yer butt to the Onett Police Station later!Npc0127:
Can you take over?
You're busy.
Just kidding.
Ah!
So you've realized that this is our hideout?
(Oh!...
This is not a hideout!
I must totally stand out...

Yesterday,Npc0162:
I heard there's a big foot print on the hilltop behind this shack.
I haven't seen it myself...
Uh, huh.
Yep,Npc0128:
This shack was locked by someone from City Hall,
The reason it was closed was 'cause a punk named Frank may have trashed the place.
What a drag.
We can't even change our clothes,
Wow.
Here's a trinket for good luck.
I decided that...
you have too many items to carry, and are unable to carry more.
After you've organized your items why don't you come back.
Do you like traveling too?Npc0129:
A library is a nice place to learn stuff.
I got a lot of info about EarthBound.
You can borrow maps for nothing!
What a cute, yellow backpack.
It's a good idea to talk to lots of people.
If she's in a good mood,
Hey!Npc0343:
(I'm not an enemy.
I'll tell you how to distinguish between your friends and enemies.
It's easy to tell an enemy just by looking at them.
Enemies look like humans with weird-colored faces.
However... you can't get more powerful if you avoid your enemies.)
(You listened to my advise and fought courageously.Npc0131:
The arcade is full of Sharks.
Hurray!
Except I don't have any money to play the games...Npc0132:
A girl namedHer mother runs a preschool out of their home.
I can't remember the name of the school, Why is she special?
I forgot to ask.
Ah, it's you...
Aren't you the extraordinary girl from Twoson?

Can I have your autograph?
Npc0163:
What?
He's in the backyard of the game arcade,
You might want to visit him.Npc0001:
Hey kid!
Don't be such a snob!
Come back after you finish EarthBound!
Hello!Npc0002:
It was you!
You'd better just beat it!
Yeah?Npc0003:
Uh huh... Uh huh...
You sound like a real whiner to me.
Don't get lippy,
You sure are strong!Npc0004:
Spit spit spit  Saliva spit spit  Do you want some gum?
Get yer own,Npc0005:
To tell you the truth,
I like drinking tea and eating fresh vegetables,
but that doesn't fit my super cool image.
I guess I just have to accept this about myself.Npc0006:
Frank has an incredibly powerful weapon.
If you get your hands on it,
So you're a real Rambo-type guy?
I don't think so.Npc0009:Npc0008:Npc0010:
Hey,
but you should call your mom.
She's probably got an ulcer from worrying about you.
The younger manager of this shop has a strange way of talking...
Anyway,
not just stuff you need right now.Npc0014:
My land!
Would you answer it?
Pokey's waiting for you.
Could you get that?
I know that the dog is unreliable,
The Cracked Bat in Tracy's room could help out at a time like this...
No matter what anyone says,
You're my very own natural born fighter...You'll go far...
Remember to
But,
Yeah,
I think it's great the way you kids have been working together.
You're back!
Mothers understand these things.
You're hungry already?
Why don't you have some Pokey, Good morning,
I'm so proud of you!
Good morning everyone!
I think all of you are the bee's knees.
You are all so... cool!
Oh,
There are plenty of creepy monsters running around Onett now.
The townspeople are barricaded in their homes,
I'm fine...
Everything will be okay if we just sit here quietly in the dark.
Are you hungry?
Do you want to eat some I agree.
Are you more relaxed?
Okay...
Wow,
I'd like to hear all of your stories,
but I don't want to annoy you as soon as you walk through the door.
I want to have a chance to get to know your little girlfriend.
It's good to meet you,
After all your chats with people you met on your adventure are finally over,
please come back here.
The photo-man brought an album by.
I'd like to look at it with you...

Did you finish doing everything that you wanted to?You'd better do everything,you can't stop!
Okay!
You did so well!Npc0016:
(I've got fleas sucking me dry,
(Besides humans,
(Do you want me to go with you?)    (Oh,
(I guess I have no choice.
(I don't wanna go out anymore.
I don't care if everyone thinks I'm a stubborn mutt.)
(At this point,
don't you think?)
(Other dogs haven't figured it out yet,
but I know that you guys saved the world!)
(I like being at home,
Can't ya see--Npc0021:
Beeeep...

Hello,

Work to exhaustion when you're young...

Have you ever heard of a weird saying like this?
Just remember,
I know that you're brave.
Don't forget to call me periodically during your adventure.
I can make a record of your progress when you call me.
Oh yeah,
Do you have your ATM card?
Withdraw your money from any cash machine and buy whatever you need.
Good Luck,
What?
Slam!
Hello?
Ah!
It's me,
You remember--
I never got the money back that you borrowed,
but,
I just wanted to let you know.
Gotta go now--
Slam.Npc0017:
Hey!
When I took Picky to the place where the meteorite landed...
Oh!
Anyway,
the police that were guarding the meteorite landing left suddenly
to deal with the Sharks.
and they were really going wild.
I blame the cops... it certainly wasn't my fault at all.
When my dad gets back,
You're my bestest friend.If you refuse me,
Will you come with me?Okay, okay... I won't say anything to hurt you.
Will you please come with me?Ok,
Before we go,  Don't you agree,
Before we go,
You're not taking anything on our big adventure?
Why don't you look around for yourSorry about giving you this game-type advice, but you should equip your weapon!
Do you know whatequip
means?It meansuse
orwear.

You must equip items in order to use or wear them.

Equip
is used a lot in games like this,
but you already knew that...
Okay,
All right!
Let's get going!Npc0020:
I'll do everything I can to help you!
You might get hungry along the way,
You can also leave anything you don't need with me.
Do you want me to hang on to something?Be careful!
You have too much stuff.
What?
I wonder when I got this from you?
Ooops!
Goody!
You've got a lot of catching up to do with your schoolwork, *Hyork*!
If you have any problems with your assignments,
Don't get freaked out.
Did Escargo Express,
I've saved some money,
You also got a new girlfriend?
Do you need help with anything other than your schoolwork?Okay,Npc0033:
If you buy something from me,
I'll give you a big discount,Npc0034:
It seems like I'm always here...Npc0035:
I'm so much more relaxed here...
They never ask meNpc0040:Npc0041:
I want to tell you the story of the creature from the vegetable soup,
but I won't because I don't want to bother you with a story
that has nothing to do with your adventure.
If I keep talking about unrelated stuff,
you might start ignoring important messages.
It's important for you to talk to people.
Also,
depending on when you speak to them.
Thank you for taking the time to talk to me again.
Ah!
Yes!
Isn't it nice to talk to so many people?
I gave you some advice when I spoke to you the first time,Npc0042:
I like cottage cheese on bread!
You haven't tried it?Npc0045:
My husband is very soft-hearted.
Where in sam hill have you boys been?
I'll have to think of a suitable punishment!
As usual,
My son isn't at home now.
My husband is also gone.
He always has great advice.
You'll be happy that you met him.Npc0048:
Salutations!
I heard that your family is in debt.
Well, live and learn.Npc0052:
My dad really got after me.
He said I get no dessert for the rest of the decade...Npc0053:
I don't wanna look at the meteorite anymore.
I haven't seen you in a while.
I'm nowhere near as cool as you.Npc0059:
Our nightly rate is not cheap,
but we have clean sheets, and the rooms are secure.
I'm sure you understand that this keeps us very busy.Npc0062:
You look like you'd be a real target for the Sharks.
You'd better be careful.Npc0063:
Can you believe it?
A group of ruffians spit their gum on me as I was passing by...Npc0065:
Do you actually think you can just come up and talk to me anytime you want?Npc0066:
I've seen you around a lot lately.  He he he.Npc0067:
The townspeople are in a state of confusion.
At times like this,
so we police are being ultra cautious.
Why is the road to Twoson closed?
At times like this,
Anyway,Well then,
Okay, *chortle*
I've been playingEarthBound
lately...
So you've traveled all over the world.
I bet you didn't meet anyone stronger than I,
I know that you didn't...  Wa ha ha ha!Npc0068:
I would rather be working as a parking meter cop...
It's just been too busy lately.
Well,
Hooray!Npc0069:
Man,
Why are you asking about a driver's license?
You're way too young to even think about getting behind the wheel,Npc0070:
So here you are.
You're the little delinquent that came back from Giant Step!
Now you listen here...

Don't Enter
means just that--
And furthermore...
Blah
Blah
It's usually those tax evaders who...
Blah blah
Blah blah
We don't enjoy blocking off the roads,
Blah blah
Blah blah
It's usually the local whiners that make a big deal about emergencies and meteorites!
Blah blah
Blah blah
Blah blah
Didn't you see theDon't Enter
sign?
That means I'm there to stop you when you're on your way out!
So pay attention next time...
And furthermore...
Blah,
Blah,Npc0072:
Psst!
I'm a cop,Npc0077:
Let's go,
'scuse me!Npc1312:Npc1313:Npc1314:Npc1315:Npc1316:Npc1317:
I am your courage.
I follow you here in Magicant.
...My name?
Let's say Flying Man.
I'll be your courage.
I'll remain unless you lose your courage.
Call me Flying Man 2.
I'm Flying Man 3.
Your courage hasn't died yet.
Let's go!
I'm also your courage.
Call me Return of the Flying Man!
...How's that?
However... don't treat us like trash.
Of course, we're your courage.
But we warned you not to treat us like trash!
Didn't you get it?!
This isn't courage, it's desperation.
If you don't understandcourage,

Okay?
My name's The Final Flying Man.
Did you want to talk to me?
I'm sorry,Npc1318:
Please rest.
The dream you'll have here is a dream within a dream.
Your heart knows things you aren't aware of.
Do you want to sleep?
Okay.
If you walk outside,Npc1342:
OhYeah, that's right.
You can't even think about being tired at a time like this.
Be strong!
If you wish, you can stay here forever.
I'll make some Npc1343:

(I'm just a faint memory.
But you've heard my song in the back of your mind.)Npc1322:
This is the realm of Magicant, which your mind created.
Why don't you explore your mind.Npc1323:
It's me...
Hey, let's play ball.
Do you prefer reading comics or playing games?
What?Npc1324:
You kicked my butt badly...
I won't forget!Npc1325:
You destroyed my pride...

I still feel pain where you wounded me.Npc1327:

I think you can get out by going over the gate...
But you need to get some stuff to take with you.Npc0634:
Okay,Well...
I don't know where you're going or why,
but remember,
Hello, this is Apple Kid.
I just wanted to let you know that I finished a pretty unique invention.
I'm not sure if it will help you or not...
It's calledZombie Paper,
and it can be used to trap zombies.
It works kind of like fly paper...
All you need to do is place the paper on the floor of a tent or something...
You've seen at least one tent around, right?....
and then the zombies get stuck to the paper
when they move around inside the tent.
You can catch a lot of zombies this way...  In fact,
I bet you could get rid of all the zombies
that are terrorizing the area with this paper!
Anyway, I just asked the Mach Pizza delivery man
to deliver the Zombie Paper to you,You should get it pretty soon.
I've never actually seen a zombie, but if there really are any,
Zombie Paper would be very useful...
I'll be calling you if I come up with anything else...
*Click!* Beeeeep!
While delivering pizza, this weird guy asked me to help him out...
He wanted me to deliver this to someone named...who is wandering around Threed.
No one else knows about this, right?
Let's just pretend that you'reOh!
Just go along with me on this one, okay.
I made the decision that you'reThat's right,I've done my duty and given you Apple Kid's thingamajig...
Well, goodbye!...
You have too much stuff, so I can't give this to you...
Why don't you get rid of something?Look, this is really important!
You've got to dump something!!All righty, I'm just going to hang out around here, then.
Ya gotta have some space for this thing by the time I come back, okay?
Hang on!
Hello, this is Apple Kid.
I've come up with another wacky invention that I think has real potential.
Maybe you won't, but anyway...
it's called theGourmet Yogurt Machine.

It makes many different flavors of yogurt.
The only problem is,
it can only make trout-flavored yogurt...
So, I'm having the machine delivered to you via Escargo Express.
It's comingNeglected Class.

Hopefully, you'll get it soon.
(Kaboooom!)
Uh, I'vegotsomeproblems  heregottago, bye!
*Crash*
Ooops!
*Crunch*
Ooops!
...Greetings!  (It's Escargo Express's neglected class.)
Whew!
There was this sunbathing guy,
and he told me about a cave with lots of monkeys... or was it orangutans?
Anyway,
Yep, I forgot... actually I forgot the stuff I was supposed to deliver, too.
I think it was some weird machine to make trout-flavored yogurt.
Yeah, I forgot it at the desert...
I'm not going back that way, so don't ask me to get the package...
I mean,
So YOU go get it!
Go on, get out of here.
Maybe that thing I forgot is important to you...
So... have a good time in the desert!...                                                 Pictures taken instantaneously!
I'm a photographic genius,  if I do say so myself!
Okay,
Look at the camera...  Ready...
Say,           Wow, what a great photograph!
It will always bring back the fondest of memories...                           
We're finally coming near to the end of our research on...
how to change a boiled egg back into a raw egg.
By the way, Apple Kid is missing.
He left here saying that he was going to see Dr. Andonuts in Winters,
and he never came back.
I was hoping to borrow the bookOvercoming Shyness
from him,
but suddenly, he disappeared...
I haven't read the book, so I'm not very good at talking... sorry.
I'm also working hard on my invention,
Say hello to your friends for me!
*click*
Hello, it's been a while since we talked...
We're having beautiful weather here...
I'm now at Dr. Andonuts lab in Winters.
The doctor doesn't seem to be around right now,
but I'm just working on my Eraser Eraser Machine...
!
Hey!
Who are you ?
Hello!  How are you?
I think I'm a real genius... In fact,
Why?
We have to fight and defeat this being...
To do so, we need to invent a machine called thePhase Distorter.

I've got to find the wandering scientist,
Dr. Andonuts, and make the distorter.
Later... *click*
Hello!  This is Orange Kid.
Sorry I haven't called lately.
I'm still working on the way to change boiled eggs into raw eggs.
It's taking longer than I thought...
I'm going to really work at it, though... talk to me later.

in my humble opinion.
Excellent, excellent!  Everything proceeded as planned.
Dr. Andonuts, Mr. Saturn and I worked together
and finally completed the Phase Distorter.
The purpose of the device is to enable instantaneous travel
through space and time.
In this prototype, you can only travel to different points
within the same time period.
It is able, however, to search out the locations of enemies.
Right now, it is indicating the presence of enemies in the Lost Underworld!
The chance of Giygas gaining victory with his monstrous plan is 99%.

and stole the device!
Hmmmm...
If I only had a piece of a meteorite,
I might be able to extract some Zexonyte.
Ah, yes!  This is fantastic!  What?
Well, I've never actually seen this incredibly rare element before...
It is very intriguing.

Let me know when your preparations are complete.
Good.
Are you ready?

Yes...
Leave everything to us, and you get some rest.
This is getting most fascinating!
It's a miracle!
A miracle that has only happened because of your great courage!
...Believe me,
I just wish I could have come with you as a robot.
I should have used the Phase Distorter.
What a story that would have been...

Scientist and four kids save the world!
Npc0729:
The Apple Kid was lost, and he was just wandering around, so I brought him here.
That was quite a while ago...
Ah,
It looks like things are pretty rough.
I'm not sure what will happen, but I sense big-time trouble ahead for you.
I'm going to stay here for a while and help Mr. Saturn.
It's important for a man to enjoy doing his duty.
Incredible!  Excellent!
I'm not quite sure what for, but congratulations on a job well done!
If we ever have the chance to get together again,
let's go on a picnic or something.
Maybe we could play horseshoes, too!Npc0742:  springs...  Rest here.)Npc0730:  Boing.

Our travels together end here.
I must return to Dalaam, and use this experience for the good of my country.
Let me demonstrate a strange power before I go.
PSI Farewell!  Now!
It was great to hang out with you guys.
I'm glad that I had the chance to use some of the theories
that I have been studying so hard.
It's remarkable.
.....
If...
Just maybe...
Well, if you two get hitched someday,
maybe I'll be the one that fixes your broken electronic appliances.
.....
I'm going to stay here for a while and see if I can learn more from Dr. Andonuts.
I mean,
...So it looks like this is good bye for now,Npc0734:
It was fun hanging out together.

Well then,
I'll miss all of you,
Well,
Thank you for escorting me home.
.....
...There was something I wanted to tell you, but I've forgotten it.
I'm sure I'll remember by the time I see you again.
Well,
Good-bye.
Uhhh... ...So long
...See ya.
...Bye.
I really should go home.
Don't you think so?
All right.
You remember where it is, right?
Let's go...
Well...  Okay.  I guess I would like to be with you a little longer.Npc0707:  down?

(You enjoyed the hot springs immensely.
(You got in and washed all of the extremely dirty gunk off of your body.)Npc0212:
This is the cycle shop
Bicycles are so much fun and are so convenient...
It's a lot faster than walking.
You'll be really popular with the biking crowd.
Do you want a bicycle?Oh... you don't know how to ride a bike.
Me neither.
Unfortunately, we don't have any more bikes for sale.
Do you want to rent one?I really like your straight-forward style.
I'll tell you what,
You know that two people can't ride on one bicycle,
so of course three or four people on a bike would be impossible!
Did you also know that you can't ride a bike with anything following you?
Teddy bears, for example...
Carrying a bear and riding is impossible for you.
And don't even think about riding a bike into a cave.
You have too many items.
I know you want it now,
Didn't you already borrow a bicycle?
You're here to return your bike?
Look how low your seat is!
That's it!
Yeah,
Hey!
Do you wanna ride a bike?
That's not gonna work... two people on one bike is strictly forbidden.
You're here to return the bicycle?Well,
You know that two people can't ride a bike,
but did you know that you can't ride a bike
when you are carrying an unconscious friend's stuff?
Carrying a lot of items and riding aroud is impossible for you.Npc0213:

I'm not going to ask the two of you where you were wandering...Npc0215:

Oh, boy!
You're both fine... I'm so relieved!

No, I don't need to hear about what happened...

Hmm... I understand.

You can even sleep on the living room couch instead of the one in the den...Npc0220:
Greetings.
Have you heard of me?
I have a lot of inventions in development, but I'm running short of cash.
I'm basically a happy-go-lucky person,
You know,
that would really help you in Peaceful Rest Valley.

You're actually willing to help finance the project?I guess I was just too hopeful.

I hope you'll accept theWhat?!
Well, perhaps you shouldn't be yappin' about having cash then,
I'm hard at work... don't worry,
Okay, okay...
I'm having more trouble than I expected.
I found a problem in one of Einstein's theories...
You didn't invest any money in my venture,
but someone else donated a few million bucks,
So would you like to invest,Oh,
...And you never heard how much money I got, too.
Well, you never invested in my genius,
You had no idea of what I could do...
*chortle*
You sorry loser.
Did you come here to get your investment money back?
No?
I promise I'll finish my brilliant invention.
I rely on your support,Npc0221:
Well,
I know it's a bit of a pig sty,
I'm Apple Kid.
I haven't taken a bath in quite a while,
If you do,
Well, go ahead and make yourself comfortable anyway.
What can you give me?
Please choose something edible... I'm not a garbage can, you know.
Maybe you would like to invest some money in my inventions?
Yes!
By the way, I could really use $200.
Thank you.
Oh, you don't have any money, do you?
Maybe you shouldn't spend too much time wandering around Twoson.
It seems like you are expecting something from me.Npc0222:
I am a mouse.
I am a mouse.
You took care of my master.
In return,
Oh!Unfortunately,Npc0226:
Hello,
Sorry,
Oh, pardon me.
See you.
Please show me your ticket.
Here you go.
The show is on hold for a while.
How do you do?Npc0228:
Oh, here you are!Npc0227:
I guess I lost my ticket,
The ticket counter at the department store was even sold out.
*Sniff*Npc0340:
Didn't I see you at the Topolla Theater in Fourside?
So you're a Runaway Five groupie, too!Npc0335:
I am a mouse.
My master, Apple Kid, has been waiting for you.
We started to nod off while waiting...Npc0229:
Lucky of the Runaway Five told me I could go backstage,
I'm sure security will stop me.
I can't believe it!
I could pose as your sister.
Ooo.
Thank you for your kindness!
I'm gonna miss the Runaway Five when they finally leave.Npc0232:
The Runaway Five are going to be a world-famous band someday.Npc0233:
Do you like baseball?Ah... I see.
Well, you don't look like you could figure out
a sophisticated game like baseball anyway.
I knew it!
You have the graceful movement of a baseball player.
I'm on a baseball team,Npc0234:

This machine will eradicate all pencil-shaped figures in just one second.
It's incredibly powerful.
I'll call you if I invent another brilliant item.Npc0906:
The Dinosaur Museum doesn't have any real dinosaurs...
I'm sure everyone knows that.
If you still want to go see the dinosaurs,
pay 5 dollars apiece for the entrance fee.
Maybe you thinkOr are you just not interested in dinosaurs.
Please enter.
You don't even haveYou don't deserve to go in the museum.
The Dinosaur Museum doesn't have real dinosaurs...
But I guess everyone knows that.Npc0908:
I'm so happy there are some visitors today.
...I'm Mr. Spoon, the academic researcher.
I wonder if there are any famous stars here today?
Dinosaurs...
Huge,
You wanna hear more?
(Whispering) To tell you the truth...
I heard that dinosaurs were found near the lower side of Scaraba,
and there were lots of them.
There are unconfirmed reports
that the dinosaurs ate some of the natives there.
If you go,
You want to know about somethingextraordinary
?
.....
Hmmmm...
...You know, there's a new singer named Venus at the Topolla Theater.
Could you bring me her autograph on an eraser?
Then, I'll show you somethingextraordinary.

...Oh,
I don't care if the autograph is written on toilet paper...
Please come back again to study,
'cause I don't like being alone...
You got it!
That banana peel has an authenticVenus
autograph?
Yep,
Now for my promise.
I'll tell you about somethingextraordinary.

In the next room, there is a light shining from far, far below the manhole.
There,
I'm not trying to pull your leg...
I'll let you go there and check it out for yourself.Npc0909:
As I thought,
Yes, I have sure-fire proof.
I've seen them in so many movies,Npc0910:
...I wonder how many animals go extinct before human beings discover them.
I wanna see a live dinosaur sometime in my life.Npc0911:
Huge!...
Not you,Npc0912:
This museum should sell dinosaur t-shirts.Npc0914:Npc0916:Npc0917:
One person requested ashampoo and cut.

They must have thought that abad hair day
could be treated at the hospital.
Either that or they wanted their medical insurance to cover their grooming.Npc0920:Npc0921:
Would you like to buy tickets for the Topolla Theater?
Oh, I see.
You're not a customer.
Orchestra seats and balcony seats are sold out.
Now, there'sstanding room only
left.
Is that okay with you?
Thanks a lot.
I've never heard of anyone who doesn't even have $30!
Ho
Oh, excuse me for my laughing in your face.
Sorry, but you can't carry all of these...Npc0922:Npc0923:Npc0924:
Everything's so expensive...
What did you do during the power outage?
I was sitting here 'cause I was scared.Npc0932:Npc0926:Npc0927:
Mumble, mumble, mumble... man,
Don't bother me, kid.
I want to get out of here,
because they suddenly shut down the store and the power goes out.
There are lots of strange things happening in this department store.Npc0928:
Oh, so you're skipping school too, right?
I heard a sound likegwaaargh!
and it was loud.
I wonder if someone was fighting.Npc0929:
When I grow up,
Do you have any connections with those guys?
Oh, you didn't have to answer.
It was dumb of me to ask you that question.
The power supply to the game was cut off.Npc0930:
I wanna save up some money and go to Summers or somewhere else to relax.
Certainly, it's very dangerous living in the city.Npc0941:
Gwaaagh, Gwarrrgh!.
You finally made it.
This department store is gonna be your grave!
You will be gone, and you'll be burning in...
Well, you'll go to heaven!
...Even though you could beat me...
Master Giygas will avenge me...
At this moment,Gwaaaaarrrrgh!!Npc0942:
The city of Fourside has developed quite a bit
since Mr. Geldegarde Monotoli hit the big time.
That Mr. Monotoli has lost quite a bit of his resources...
In the future, you will build cities and even create a country...
...I'm counting on you.Npc0943:
I've heard some bad rumors about Mr. Monotoli.
I heard he made a deal with a pure evil entity in exchange for power...
you know... stuff like that.
Just as I thought,
My grandpa told me that everyone has at least one outstanding skill.
When I look at you, I know he's right.Npc0944:
In the old days, Mr. Monotoli was just a regular,
unattractive real estate agent.
Now he has the power to control the police force.
I don't think the city of Fourside is better than before.
You're very young,
but you brought something very precious back to the people in this town.
Thank you.Npc0945:
The Runaway Five from Twoson seem very popular.
I heard that the Topolla Theater is always full.
I heard you're friends of the Runaway Five.Npc0946:
Speaking of the Topolla Theater,
She's better than the Runaway Five.
I'm totally bonkers about her...
Venus...
She's become even more beautiful.Npc0947:
I don't get it.
I heard that a guy who looks like Monotoli has been hanging out at Jackie's Cafe.
You know, the totally unpopular place.
I heard he quietly goes in and out.
Jackie's Cafe was where the deal with the evil entity took place.
I can't believe it... can you?
You boys are young,Npc0948:
No one know anything.
Monotoli's toadies stole everything from me,
Weep, weep...
They are evil incarnate.
Lawyers,
They're all his toadies!
No matter how you fight him,
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay... just leave me here to cry into my cappucino!
Nosy!
Hic!
I'm fine.
Hic!
I'm not drinking the...
I hate these hiccups...
Yes, they're...
Another cappucino here!
Hic!Npc0949:
Protect Mr. Monotoli first.
The safety of the citizens of this city comes second.
Heh heh heh.  That's our job, you know.
Heh heh.
It was stupid of me to let Monotoli do whatever he wanted.
We'll do our best to create an environment in which people can live safely.
You're getting in better shape every time I see you.
Don't you wanna be a police officer?Npc0950:
You boys are sneaking around, looking for Mr. Monotoli, aren't you?
If I catch you boys doing anything,
Be prepared!
Ha ha ha.
I've already checked out your name...
Oh, that rude comment was a slip of the tongue.
Now I feel like Monotoli should eat my shorts..
I misjudged you guys.
I thought you were little snot-nosed punks.
...I know better now.Npc0951:
I kept asking around for Trout-flavored yogurt, but...
What?
May I have it?
Now I can make Trout-flavored yogurt for my guests.
...You are so kind, I'll make some for you.
My room's on the 48th floor.
My room's on the 48th floor.Npc0952:
.....
*Wheeze, wheeze*...
.....
Aren't you...I can't see too well...
Everything's blurry...
It's me, we met in Twoson...
You must remember.
That... Carpainter in Happy Happy Village was hiding something...
*wheeze, wheeze*... strange.
I stole it, and thought about selling it in the big city...
An old, city-wise man called it Mani Mani.
It's a strange-colored, doll-looking thing.
...Ohh... *wheeze*,  I'm in pain.
...and
.....
Monotoli tricked me and stole it...
He tricked a thief!
He wanted me out of the way because I know his secret...
He gets his evil power from that statue!
...Listen!
I'll tell you only once.
At the cafe,
...*Gasp*...
I said I'd tell you only once...
But if you insist, I'll tell you once more...
...*gasp, gasp*
Do
I've told you twice already...
But if you wanna hear one more time...
I'll tell you once more...
D...
I'm not that nice of a guy.
I'm slipping away...
...Before I go, here's my last haiku poem:
When on your way out
Be sure that you say goodbye
then lock the door tight.
This is my final request...  Don't follow me.
I must be on my way...
Whoa...
So...Npc0953:
There's a person lying on the ground.
I wonder if he's... he's...
He's not dead...
I thought he may have passed on.Npc0954:
Oooo... I don't like seeing a corpse around here.
He should really go to the hospital like other sick people do.Npc0955:
He's breathing...
Has he just been playing too hard?
Do you know him?
You must be a dangerous kid!
I'll bet you're on your way to Jackie's Cafe right now!Npc0956:
Don't cut in front of me!
If you give me somethin', I'll let you have my spot.
Will you give me somethin'?
Then stay right there where you're too short to see a thing!
So, what do I get?
Are you sure?
If you don't want to give me somethin',
don't say you're gonna give me somethin'...
All right, take my place.
Give me somethin' that makes me really happy!
And do it in a nice way!
Don't you feel better since you had the chance to talk with your friend?
I helped you find him.Npc0957:
Oh, no no no.
I'm glad it wasn't me.
Is that man going to... to...?Npc0958:
He doesn't look like a nice man.
He stared right at me...
Ooo... it was scary!Npc0936:Npc0959:Npc0995:
You finally got here.
This is the fifthYour Sanctuary
location.
Take it from me,Npc0961:
What happened to those guys digging for the buried gold?
If they found the gold, it would be worth a huge amount of money.
They'd be able to pay off a million dollar debt very easily.
If I were them, I'd go to Japan and live it up!
I heard they couldn't find the buried gold.
Those guys worked really hard,Npc0962:
I wonder why the department store's closed.Npc0963:
When Monotoli became the owner,
this department store began having strange happenings.Npc0964:
I heard the department store finally re-opened.
Hope they have a boffo sale.Npc0965:
Behind this wall, things seem very strange.
I feel like this isn't my place...
Maybe it's your place.Npc0966:
The boy stuck to the wall... may be a Peeping Tom.Npc0904:
(You were wandering around the warehouse with a vacant, far away look in your eyes.
Were you daydreaming?)
I'm lucky I'm a rat.Npc0860:
Oh,
I'm Geldegarde Monotoli.
Don't you remember me?
I returned this building to Mr. Enrich Flavor.
Now I'm working as an elevator man.
I'm very happy, and it's good to be alive.
I heard of your many successes.Npc0902:
Wheeee!

Pokey left me, his own dad, and just disappeared.
If you see him, tell him that he should take better care of his father.
Don't tell my wife in Onett that I've been spending my time here.
Hic!Npc0851:
I heard Venus made an appearance at the Runaway Five show.
I missed her 'cause I went to the bathroom.
I'll hate bathrooms for the rest of my life.Npc0852:
Oh, I can't see the Runaway Five here anymore...?
I should dump this sorry excuse of a man and become a Runaway Five groupie.Npc0969:
I'm very punctual about time and careful with money.
I don't look like it, though.Npc0064:

However, our efforts were futile, and we lost.
Nonetheless, our pyramid was protected by the gods of Scaraba.
The invaders will be reborn every millennium and will attack again.
Even now, the invaders hide beyond space and time and build their evil stronghold.

The prices here are so high, it'll make your face turn blue!
That's Summers!Npc1059:
If you're bored, go check out theScaraba Cultural Museum.

It may be helpful to you.
They have a hieroglyph from a pyramid.Npc1060:
Another nice day.
Summers always has sunny days.Npc1062:
(It's a Myna bird!)Npc1063:
To go to Scaraba,
However a monster named Kraken lives in the open sea.
He attacks ships that pass through.
Are you scared?
I'm a mighty sailor man
A mountain man I'm not
The open sea is home for me
And mountains aren't worth snot
...I'm writing a song for sailors.Npc1064:
Dinosaurs existed!
It had been out of the underground when it dried out.
Of course, it was dead!
Believe what I'm saying!Npc1065:
Would you like a boat ride?
Ok, I understand.
I don't feel like sending a ship out.
I'm worried about my wife...
I'm not afraid of the Kraken!
.....
My wife's totally ignoring her Magic cake business.
These days she spends her time hanging out in a strange club.
We no longer have any mutual interests to discuss.
Is our relationship over?
...*Sigh*
Do you wanna hear the same story again?
Thank you!  You made my wife wake up.
She quit talking about all that serious crap...
Yeah!
If you're courageous, get on this boat.
You'll probably see the Kraken and experience getting seasick!
After all, it could only cost you your life, and you got that for free!
Luck will determine the outcome of this voyage.
So, do you want to sail the seas to Scaraba?
Twenty bucks per person is fine with me.
I understand.
Stay here and shiver in fear for your future!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Ready!
Bon Voyage!
What?
Come back after you make some money.
Compared to the olden days, this boat ride is like being on a luxury liner.
Do you want another ride?
I'll give you a ride if you want, since you destroyed the Kraken.Npc1067:
Fsst Fsst.Npc1068:
Meow.Npc1002:
I've finally awakened the inner me, the true self.
The patrons of this club are able to stare into their own soul hard
enough to burn a hole in their psyche.
I'm now comfortable enough to stare at the real me, the true self,
and burn the impression into my super-ego.
I want to be in this comfort zone at any time, all the time or at no time.
My id is telling me...
What?  What?
You came all this way just to eat my Magic Cake?
Okay then,
I
Why don't you stop by a little cart out on the beach later?Npc1066:
Only a tanning pro like me is able to get an actual suntan on the palms of his hands!Npc1070:
I'm just trying to take a nap in the shade.Npc1031:
Pooooweeeet!  Oooo... sorry...
Y'know, I can't quite describe it...
Drinking glass after glass of ice coffee is... well...
Buuuurp!  Oooo... 'scuse me...Npc1077:
(East of here is the port town of Toto)
...No, no...  I'm not a billboard...
(Have a fantastic vacation!
At least until you run out of money.      Hotel Du Summers)
There is graffiti on the board... The handwriting is hard to read...
(  For a neighbor, he's a loser!)Npc0456:
How can we defeat the zombies?
We should try Zombie Paper or some kind of trap.
Just imagine... when we wake up tomorrow morning...
Ugh! *shiver* It'll be really gross.Npc0542:
Yuck!
The monsters are no longer in the tunnel!
Since the tunnel was cleared,
It's incredibly noisy.Npc0457:
Why don't we get all the zombies in this tent and then set it on fire?
We may all get munched before we have a chance to do anything...
Maybe a good idea would be to try to get all the zombies into a single spot.
Hey!  Stupid zombies!
The suspense is killing me...Npc0540:
I was able to arrest  many zombies because of your help.

Arrest
sounds strange, doesn't it...
It became really quite peaceful compared to before.Npc0458:
I'm glad you're going to help us,
Well, we'll give it a try.
Here, zombie, zombie, zombie...  I have a nice bone for you...Npc0541:
You might not understand my saying this,
Now you can go through the tunnel anytime you want!
Actually, I'm kind of glad I got to see real zombies.Npc0459:
The zombies are slowly advancing toward the tent.
Everyone, I repeat--
So, this weird object was flying around and crashed in the graveyard...
It looked like it was straight out of a
Wow!  Did you come here in that flying contraption?
So you're going to use this tent as a trap...
Hey, hey, hey! ...stupid zombies... come on over!Npc0539:
We did it!
Ya ha!  We taught those stupid zombies a lesson!
That round flying object... a kid with glasses was on board.
The craft landed near the graveyard, right?
Can you fix it?It was heavily damaged, though, right?
It's such a waste, but we can't do much about it...
I didn't like fighting the zombies,Npc0477:
We painted over all the damaged parts of the Sky Runner.
Now I wonder how you start this thing up?Npc0478:
I want you to stay,
Thanks for every little ol' thing.Npc0498:
Be careful while walking around outside,
Especially near the graveyard,
But now it's been cleaned up, so it's safe, Npc0499:Npc0500:
I'm stronger than a zombie,
If you would have taken me along to hunt zombies or something,
I would have been a big help.Npc0502:
The zombies got me...
I should have gotten some zombie insurance.
I'm not afraid of no zombie.
When they come out, I'll beat them by myself.
Actually I don't want them to come out.Npc0503:Npc0504:Npc0505:Npc0509:Npc0515:
Zombies and ghosts are on the loose here.
Zombies and ghosts are
Oh yeah, you guys got rid of the monsters.  Ooops!  He he.Npc0516:
Zombies and ghosts are on the loose here, so I can't get to Twoson or Fourside.
Maybe the hidden road in the graveyard is safe...
You guys got rid of the zombies,
'cept the ghosts in the tunnel seem scarier than ever!
If you weren't here,Npc0517:
This town seems very dark, right?
The people are mostly living at the center of town.
I wonder how we should get the town back from the zombies?
This town used to be dark,Npc0518:
Hey, you don't look so happy,
Some people have already become tools of the zombies.
*smooch*  Tee hee hee...  I'm blushing.Npc0519:
The headquarters of the Zombie Relief Corps
is in the circus tent at the center of town.
We want to crush the zombies, except I think they'll crush us.
I thought the zombies were gone...  But look at the surroundings...
It's still dark!
We won because of our brains,
Wow!Npc0520:
There's a rumor that there is an underground path at the edge of the graveyard
that takes you somewhere.
When you get through the path,
you'll meet a dirty,
I wet my pants just thinking about it.
You've been through some tough battles!Npc0521:
?
I saw another tent to the south.  I wonder when it went up?
That strange tent...
I'm glad I didn't go inside!
Visit Threed again!Npc0522:
I'm so scared of the zombies, I spend all of my time running from them.
I can't even get home!
I had to run all over to escape the zombies.
Now I can't remember where my house is...Npc0511:
Hey, do you remember me?
I had to run all over to escape the zombies.
Now I can't remember where my house is...
I told you this before, remember?
Huh?  I never saw you before?
I guess I can't remember anything right.Npc0523:
(You're awfully kind taking time out to talk to a mouse.Npc0524:
Owoooo!Npc0525:
How can you smile like that in a dangerous place like this?
I thought there was something more to you than just your smile.Npc0526:
I saw a beat-up tour bus going to Fourside.
The band was really noisy,
It must be great to be so happy-go-lucky, huh!
I wanted to catch one of the ghosts in the tunnel and keep it as a pet.
I'm just teasin'.  I can tease like that now that they're gone.Npc0527:
I'm only telling you this because you look like you're just passing through.
The truth is,
The humans seem to be losing,
so I'm on the zombies' side for my own protection.
The zombies' leader likes Fly Honey.  He makes his followers collect it.
You know--bees make bee honey and flies make Fly Honey.
The zombie leader is strong because
he always eats peanut butter and Fly Honey sandwiches...
I got lots of Fly Honey stored in the tent to the south.
I'll deliver it to the zombie leader soon.
I heard that you beat the zombie leader
after you got some important info from me.
Heh heh heh...
You should at least thank me... or how about a shoulder massage...
Why are you giving me such a dirty look, you brat!
...Since then, I've really matured.
I am doing well in the health food business.
People can get over any illness they might catch.
Don't you think it's a great business?Okay... so it's not for you.
I could make you believe anything...Npc0528:
After the buses started running again,
I decided to come see my boyfriend... I really shouldn't have, though.Npc0529:
Wo!  Dude!
I'm totally bummed, 'cause I have another girlfriend here in Threed.Npc0530:
Ha ha ha ...check him out.
I think he's the bee's knees,
GaNpc0534:
(He stares into your soul.)
(He stares into your soul.)
(He looks you over.)Npc0535:
(He looks you over.)Npc0536:Npc0537:
Take a look at that chick in front of the hotel.
Regardless of some of the people I've seen her hanging out with,
I think I'd like to spend some time with her!Npc0513:
I overheard the zombies whisper,

Master Belch will give us our lives back.

...Master Belch is the zombie leader.
Like I told you, there was a barfy bad guy named Belch.
Thank you for giving him the big flush.
This town has completely changed from the first time you were here.
Can you feel the love?Npc0514:
That's right, there is a rumor that a monster called Belch is screwing up the town.
Belch!
Bu
Oops... now I'll getBelch
for a nickname.  Hee hee hee... uh... crud.
Isn't your backpack worn out?Npc0512:
Yeah, I worked for the zombies,
but I betrayed them too.
Belch gives life to the zombies, but Belch works for Giygas,
who I heard might be female.
Well, I'm not really sure whether Giygas is a male or a female.
I'm a helpful con man, don't you think?Npc0551:
I saw a suspicious woman talking with the zombies around here.Npc0475:
Frankly, I'm running scared.
I don't mean that I actually run around.
Conditions in the town are getting worse.
This guy at the pizza joint told me about a new product calledZombie Paper.


Zombie Paper
is a stupid product name.
Zombie Paper really works, so I hope someone comes up withpretty girl paper.

Oops,
You made our lives peaceful.  I can sleep again.
It's like you used a bunch ofpeace paper,
right?  Ha ha ha.Npc0476:
People used to call me evil, but these zombies are much more scary.
I left my wife and kids at home to escape to this tent.
That's how scary the zombies are.
You can do whatever you want--
just save my life.
Those zombies stuck to the floor...
I wonder if they could still get me.
I don't care what happens to anyone else,
The town is at peace,
What's the problem?Npc0491:
A few days ago, the zombies got some kids at this hotel.
The boy had a red cap...
The boy had a red cap...Npc0552:
Thank you for bringing peace and happiness back to Threed.  Thanks!
Peace!Npc0553:
I really didn't think those kids could have saved the town.
Who would have ever imagined it?Npc0554:
I won't forget you.
Won't you come back to Threed sometime?Npc0555:
Since the leader of the monsters is gone,
the ghosts in the tunnel have disappeared.
The buses can get through the tunnel now.Npc0556:
I want to go through the desert and on to the big city.
I want to see the city,  and I want to smell like the big city.
I'm a real urban-type of guy.Npc0557:
From the bus stop at the hotel all the way to Fourside...
is how much?  Do you remember?Npc0558:Npc0559:
You're heroes.Npc0560:
Sweet!Npc0561:
All righty!Npc0485:
I came from Fourside by bus.
Buffalo?Npc0486:
A girl in Fourside called me.
There is a really popular band there now.
I think they're called theRunway Fire.

I told you the wrong band name before.  I saidRunway Fire.

The real name isRunaway Five.

My girlfriend corrected me...Npc0562:
I heard there is a guy who is digging for buried treasure in Dusty Dunes desert.
A share of that treasureshare
would be nice.
Hey!  I heard you got a share of the treasure found in the desert.
It didn't seem to change you at all, though.Npc0563:
I'm a detective from Twoson.
The statue called Mani Mani or something or other
was stolen from the Happy-Happyism headquarters.
Do you have any clues for me?Oh, I see...
Don't try to feed me your lies!Npc0464:
If I try to get away, my body will just fall apart.
It's because I'm a zombie...Npc0460:
I'll blame you for the rest of mylife.
Npc0461:
I'll blame you after mydeath.
Npc0462:
You're the enemy of all zombies!
You monster!Npc0470:
Could... you... help me?Npc0471:
You humans are such cowards!Npc0472:
*Gasp* *Gasp*Npc0474:
I don't care if I pass away...
Ha!  I'm dead already!Message of the broken SkyWalker.Npc0481:

I understand you guys are already claiming to be heroes.
Well, it is a gazillion years too early for you to oppose Giygas!
You must feel pretty stupid to keep fighting without even knowing
what Giygas looks like!
If you were to ever see Giygas, you'd be so petrified with fear,
you'd never be able to run away!
...That's how scary it is!
So, do you want me to turn off theDevil's Machine?

Well, prepare to be amazed!
So, isn't this terrifying?  I'm terrified, too.
Giygas cannot think rationally any more,
and he isn't even aware of what he is doing now.
His own mind was destroyed by his incredible power.
What an all-mighty idiot!
Yep, that's what he is!
Heh heh heh heh...  and you... you will be...  just another meal to him!
Heh heh heh heh.  You must really be  at the end of your rope.
In this bizarre dimension,  you four are the only force fighting for justice...
And here you stand,
waiting to be burned up with all the rest of the garbage of this universe...
Haaaaah!  That's so sad. I can't help  but shed a tear.
You know, my heart is beating incredibly fast,
...I must be experiencing absolute terror!
Do you want to scream for  help here in the dark?!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Why not call your mommy, Say,Mommy!  Daddy!  I'm so frightened!    I'm gonna wet my pants!

I know you have telepathy, or something, so just try and call for help,
you pathetically weak  heroes of so-called justice!
No one will help you now!
Ha ha ha haah...
Don't worry, your pitiful suffering will be over soon!
well...   I'm running away.
But perhaps I'll just sneak away to another era to think about my next plan.
It's a good bet that we will see each other again...
All right!  I'll be seeing you!
So now which one of us do you think is the cool guy?!Npc0409:
Blue... blue.
I'm a roaming doctor.  Let me know if you're not feeling well.Npc0410:
Blue... blue...
Humm dee dum dum dum.  I'm hunting for mushrooms!
Hey!  Would you be willing to sell that mushroom on your head for $50?
Ohhh...  It's your special mushroom.
Thank you.  Such a great mushroom.  I'm so happy I got it.
I'm going to collect a ton!
I'm  Dr. Saturn.  Zoom!
and I can  repair  your body.
Boing!
Do you  want me
to operate  on you?  Ding?  kay-o?
If you  all right,  that's great.

Goody!  Boing!

I don't think anyone has anything like that.
Or Is it just my misunderstanding?
I can only treat an illness.  Sorry.

What a sad look in your eyes... you, the boy in a red cap.
You must be homesick.
That's nothing you need to be ashamed of.
Anybody who is on a long trip will miss home.
In this case,

You have a cold.
You have sunstroke.

You must feel nauseous.

Who do you want to see?

Come back any time you need.
We don't have a person like that in our hospital.

You need to be examined?  Then, you need to see the doctor... not me.
I'm not busy right now.

Yeah, well, I am actually pretty busy.
If a good friend of yours becomes unconscious,
come to the hospital right away.
As long as you have money for the doctor's fee,

You guys must be quite the adventurers!
Aren't there times when you'd just like to go back home?
So, you're not some mama's boy...
Well, it wouldn't hurt you to go back and visit once in a while.
Hey, that's an awfully strange carrot.
Hahaha!

(Someone must have stepped on a switch!)
(It sounds like something up above is moving.)
(There is something on the platform.
Do you want to get it?)
(Wasn't it the whole reason you came here?)
(It's unbelievable that you would get this far,
and not claim your prize just because you have too much stuff.)Npc1193:
(This casket seems a little suspicious...)                                               It is important that I study and learn theStarstorm

Hey!  Hey, hey, hey!  Heeeeeey!!
I'm Npc0303:
Welcome!
Would you like me to tell you about Twoson?It's too much trouble for me too.
Twoson has a modern, clean hotel.
There is a hospital and the wonderful Chaos Theater.
There is the Polestar preschool,
If you're curious,
East of the town,
On the other side of the valley is Happy-Happy Village.
There's also a pizza parlor.
Do you want to know anything else?
Well, tee hee,
I've been giving out info about Twoson for years now.
I'll quit this job and I'll, tee hee,Npc0304:
Burglin Park seems kind of dangerous,Npc0305:
I hear that a girl namedwhile helping out at the Polestar preschool.
I heard that you,I heard that Npc0306:
I saw some weird bad guy followingKidnapping is wrong!
I'll be careful not to kidnap anyone!Npc0307:
I see that you're young but have had some adventures.
I think thatJust as I thought,
Just as I thought,
Well, I think you're cute...
But I'm near-sighted, too...
He's now talking to a plain,
I heard that the game has some messages that are just there for fun.Npc0308:
If you go to the east,
Peaceful Rest Valley and Happy-Happy Village are waiting for you.
I've also heard that there are UFO's in the Peaceful Rest Valley.
Well, my thoughts on happiness have changed...Npc0309:
People in Happy-Happy Village are fanatical about a strange religion.
Maybe they've got some sort of bad fever.
I'm glad to see you so healthy.Npc0310:
(There was a kidnapping!
Believe me,  Woof!)
(You're fantastic...you even take time to talk to animals.)Npc0311:Npc0312:
I own an antique shop.
No one is buying or selling anything,
so I was thinking of selling theFor Sale
Sign that sits in front of me.
It's only 98 dollars.   I bet you'll regret not buying it.
Customers will flock to you.
Oh, you can't buy it 'cause you're poor.
I can't help you if you're carrying too many things...
So, did theFor Sale
Sign help you?
Yeah,Npc0313:
Hey,Do you think it's hot?
Thank you!  That's Here you go,
You said yes,
You saidyes
- that's short and to the point.
Get rid of something and come back.Npc0314:
I sell fresh eggs.
Please buy this beautiful, beautiful egg!You won't get through your teen years without at least one egg.
Please buy this beautiful egg.Ok,
You're concerned about your health, even though you're young.
That'll beOkay,
Hey,
Eggs are easily broken.
There's no way to stuff it in with your other things if you have no more room...Npc0315:
The boss of Burglin Park is Everdred.
He's got ties to burglaries and kidnappings in this area.
He's a scary guy.
Everdred is asking for you.
I heard that the kidnapped girl was saved.
What?
That's hard to believe.
Will you give me 1,000 dollars?
I'll give you all my support.I'm glad you turned me down.
I just want to be an unknown little punk.
You shouldn't give away 1,000 dollars so easily.
Let me give it back to you.
Do you think I'm really an honest, reliable person?Npc0316:Npc0317:
It makes me feel good to just sit and look at my pots...
...I like pots,
It's right there.Npc0318:Npc0319:
Are you looking for that so-called genius, Apple Kid?
As a true genius,Npc0344:
Wo  (Go back,Npc0356:
(Happy-Happy Village ahead.)Npc0324:
Of course,
but he's actually quite warm-hearted for a crime boss.
What?Npc0325:
Everdred has always watched over Burglin Park.
That's why we don't have to bribe any crooked cops.
Even if Everdred has passed on,
from...wherever he's at.Npc0326:
I'm starting a line here.Npc0327:
I love standing in a queue.

If I had some connections,Npc0373:

We're popular, but not rich.
We're bein' cheated by this theater,
You're with a girl today.
How about introducin' her to my bandmate?  He's right there.
Thanks for talking to me.
Didn't ya go off looking for some girls?
Hey,Npc0329:
We may be popular,
but that girl who lives at the house with the preschool is the talk of the town.
I wanna see her someday.
Hey,
Then you deserve a present, playboy.
Here's aIt seems like you've got an awful lot of junk.
Get rid of somethin' and come back for the pass.
Hey,
A boy with a red cap seemed to be lookin' for ya.
I heard you're workin' hard tryin' to find the girl who lives at the preschool.
If ya find her,
With thatCome with your girlfriend...  We'll be waitin'.Npc0230:
You want to see Poochyfud, the manager?
Right through this door, please.
I'm not sure what happened,Npc0320:
Let's go to Threed!
Our tour bus is too loud for any ghosts to bother us.
Do you want a ride?If ya change your mind,
Oh yeah!Npc0331:
I heardCongratulations on solving the kidnapping.
This town feels so much more peaceful and safe...Npc0332:
I'm nuts about this one kid inventor.
No,
I'm talking about the incredibly hot Orange Kid!
The Orange Kid is deep into a world-class invention.
It must be hard being an ultra-genius.Npc0333:
That stupid slob, the Apple Kid, always asks me for something to eat.
He's the inventor--he should invent some food for himself.
That stupid slob, the Apple Kid, is suddenly missing.
I think the town seems cleaner somehow.
A while ago,

I got bit by zombies in Threed,
I left something good at the Threed Hospital,
but now I can't go get it
I'm in perfect, tip-top health now.
*cough* *hack, hack* *cough*
Thank you!
After my life,
Because you're so kind,
It's a souvenir from Scaraba.Npc0269:
I had an argument with my friend about Happy-Happyism.
My friend who joined the Happy-happy religion came to see me a while ago.
We've became friends again.Npc0270:
I wanted to see the circus in Threed, the next town over,
but I hurt my leg in the Peaceful Rest Valley.
You look healthy,
My story is the same.Well, it's not important.
Okay,
ready?Npc0330:
It's just a hunch,
but I think the ghosts in the tunnel don't like anything upbeat and cheerful.
When I was driving in the tunnel,
I was playing some grooving tunes and the ghosts moved slower.
I think the ghosts can't stand anything positive.Npc0219:

Everyone is probably worried about you.Npc0239:
Hey, you ... how did you get ?
the owner's  or something?ticketsa ticketNpc0240:
I came here because it's tough to get in,
There are no good-looking waitresses,
and there is no room for me to show off my latest dance moves.Npc0241:
Y'know, I think it's pretty tacky to entertain
our company's business partner by taking him to a Runaway Five show.
...But since I'm new to the company, I better just toe the line.Npc0242:
Well, well...he' s an adult.
I give you one thing---you got guts, kid...Npc0243:
They seem too proud... I mean,
they just filled up this little music hall after all...Npc0244:
My boyfriend lost the ticket that I gave him.
He's waiting outside the entrance.
He's got butter fingers, but he's nice.Npc0245:

I want more dough all the time.
I didn't make a spectacle of myself, did I?
That is exactly what I want.
I can't believe that you have that much...Npc0253:
The Runaway Five owe me a lot of money.
They'll stay here until they pay me back.
They might be here for 100 years,
unless you decide to pay off their debt...  Heh, heh, heh.
The Runaway Five are free to leave.
I've got no complaints now that I have my money.
Yipes!
I got the money, of course,

To take the bus, or not to take the bus... hmm.

I can't believe people exist who have no money at all...
Blue, blue!
How much would you like to donate?    $
Your good deed will be rewarded.
Go and be happy!
I wanted to give you a postcard.
You have too many items.
...no jokes allowed.
Finally, I have a chance to apologize.Npc0402:
I not know you.
My kind are in valley over there.
Bye bye.
Hi,Npc0403:Npc0423:
Mr. Carpainter wants a girl.
No, I don't mean it like that.
I meant he's looking for a girl who can be the high priestess of Happy-happyism.
I heard he's already got her.
I apologize.Npc0424:
Psss psss Psss psss
That overweight kid helped me.
You know, she's hidden in a mountain cabin.
Oh,I thought you were one of us!
Ha ha ha!... Just forget about this...
I won't tell you anything.
You really think I was a bad boy?Npc0411:What a horrible nightmare.

Please answer me.  I promise to be good.
Hah!  I lied!Npc0412:
I'm monitoring those who don't pay at the food stand.
Have you already paid?
I noticed you didn't pay!
You won this confrontation.
But the good side of you must ache with regret.  Ha ha ha.
They said someone named Pokey stole all the food from the food stand.
In a different way than before, Mr. Carpainter has become a very good man.Npc0433:
(Thanks for your support over the years.
The food stand is going out of business due to personal reasons.)Npc0413:
One day, Mr. Carpainter received a revelation.
He now speaks the real truth.
I woke up from the dream.Npc0397:
You don't seem to understand,
When the world is changed to blue,
Do you understand now?   Although you don't understand now, some day you will.
I can tell by your face that you're only pretending to understand.
You just want something!
I too was wrong in many ways.Npc0414:
Mr. Carpainter communicates with the divine,
so he is able to deliver inspired messages.
We might have been listening to evil messages rather than good.
Don't you think the mental health of everyone in the village is improved?Npc0398:
You might misunderstand what I have to say,
But Carpainter's voice affects one's minds, like a hypnotist.
Seems like I'm no longer hypnotized.Npc0415:
When I painted everything blue, as Mr. Carpainter said,
my wife who had run out on me returned home!
My wife has run away for a second time.
Wow, it's been a long time.Npc0416:
I think that those who won't paint everything blue are opposed to peace.
I want them all to listen,
We need to return the town to its original colors.
I shouldn't be so desperate to chase after happiness.Npc0417:
Blue, blue!
I wish for everything in this world to become blue.
It was hard on the eyes to have everything blue.
Hey,
You're a friend of the famous Runaway Five.Npc0418:
You want to talk to Mr. Carpainter directly?
You must think you're pretty important, and boy do you have a lot of nerve!
You deserve to be struck by lightning.
Mr. Carpainter was pretty strange.
Hi!Npc0419:

There's a place ahead that can't be painted blue.
It's a strange and anti-blue place.
I can't stop thinking about it... and I can't even go near that place.
I'm a changed person.
Anyway, I'm very curious about the place that lies ahead of here.
What was the anti-blue place like?
Was it scary?
You seem to thrive in places like that.
Did you see a huge mole, like I've heard lives there?Npc0422:
I heard many footprints exist deep down in the east cave.
People call that place Lilliput Steps, and it makes them feel uneasy.Npc0394:
It looks like almost everyone woke up and left...Npc0395:
There are only three people remaining...
I don't want to stay.Npc0396:
Sorry about everything!Npc0399:
We wanted to join the Happy-Happy religious group.
We're a married couple from Twoson.Npc0400:
Our child is waiting for us in Twoson.
As a souvenir we'd like to bring him some happiness.Npc0401:
This is the famous Happy-Happyism counseling office.
When you obtain happiness
you should visit the Happy-Happyism headquarters.
It's located at the center of the village.Npc0426:
HeySince we last met, the whole town has woken up.
The best happiness comes from being free... you kids made me realize that.Npc0435:

I'm not sure who you are, but congratulations!
No one is here now!
Hi... hello?
It's sunny out today.
I'm sorry, but I think you ought to leave now...
I have no guarantee that you're not a zombie out looking for a lunch.Npc0564:
Finally, we can again breathe deep the outside air,
now that the zombies are gone.
*SNORT*
I've lost the key to my house, so I can't get in.
No, no.  You don't need to look for it.  I'll look for it myself.
Well, now the key is broken, and I can't go out.
Don't bother yourself, I'll try to fix it on my own.
It's none of your business that we have a small house...

I don't want to go out to sea because of the Kraken.

And yet, I've heard that it's a gourmet dish.

...Saturn Valley?  What's waiting for us there?
Anyway, we need to teleport...
Hmmm... it doesn't work.
But that one material cannot normally be found on the earth.
The material I'm thinking of came from a meteorite
that fell when I was much younger.
Have you seen a meteorite anywhere recently?Hmmm...
to suddenly fall from the sky?
Mmm...
Eureka!
With even just a piece of the meteorite,
...I doubt that your mortal enemy Giygas,
or whatever, will allow you to go to Onett and get a piece of the meteorite.
By now, Onett is in his evil hands.
You must go,
The Mr. Saturns have introduced some of their new developments at their shop.
Please check them out before you leave.
...I wonder what Onett is like at this point in time?...                              The Phase Distorter has been completed.
We could finish it quickly because of Mr. Saturn's incredible scientific skill...
Giygas is attacking from our exact location,
but he is attacking from many years in the past.Npc1269:
This is very hard for me to tell you, but...Npc1270:
In order to defeat Giygas,
you must warp to the past.
This can be done by way of thePhase Distorter 3.

However, the machine cannot warp living things,
Life is demolished in the process of warping.
The only way to accomplish the time travel is
to transfer your brainprogram
into a robot,
and send the robot to the past.
...The transfer means that your spirit will go with the robot
while your body is left behind...
I cannot promise that your spirit will come back after the battle in the past.
Yet, you must understand that the four of you are the chosen ones.
Do you still wish to face Giygas by traveling to the past?Yes, it's natural to feel as you do.
The only thing left is the destruction of our planet...
...Hmmm
that you may not be able to return to your current form,
right?...Yes... I see...  You have really set your mind on this...
Let me take a good look at you now...

Ready... stand by...

There is no turning back now.

Only a few people know of your amazing courage,
but the number of people you save through that bravery is immense.

Bad guy gone.  Zoom!
Where?  To the past.
Ding, ding!Npc1273:
There was aGreetings!
Excellent!
There is only a little time left!
I must go now...
(Npc1283:
Even though I listened to the talkative Mystery Rock's story,
I don't understand what he's talking about.
The rock suddenly stopped talking.
In other words...
it's not saying anything.
...You have a nice item.
Since I came to the Lost Underworld, I haven't seen or smelled Npc1284:
What are you doing in the dinosaur's cage?
I'll open the door for you, and you get out of the cage quick.
That's an order from the boss.
(That nasty smell left you at the same time!)
Why don't you see the talkative mystery rock.
That rock really jabbers away!!
A rock that doesn't talk is no fun at all.Npc1285:
We are the same Tenda as those above ground.
...We seem different?
Yeah,
It may be my imagination,
I wonder... have they overcome their shyness?Npc1286:
Didn't you think that the Tenda up above have some particularly beautiful women?
They're still shy, though.
Tenda women up above ground are pretty, but the men seem kind of run down.Npc1287:
You're strange, but you smell good.
Did you feel the earthquake a little while ago?
...You know, we have earthquakes all the time here.
After an earthquake, the hot springs will erupt.
The blue springs are great for recovering health.
The Red springs are perfect for healing paralysis or drawing out poison.
Hey! Strange fellow.
After an earthquake, the hot springs erupt out of the ground.
Have you ever noticed that?
The blue springs are great for recovering health.
The red springs are perfect for healing paralysis or drawing out poison.Npc1288:
Tenda who like to talk came to the Lost Underworld
because we couldn't stand the quiet up above.
So, we established a separate tribe.
I hope we can be friendly again some day.
...Yeah,
You guys helped the upper tribe and the lower tribe gain unity again.
Soon, we'll be one village again!Npc1289:
We made a cage for dinosaurs and locked them up...
That's what my brother tells me.
But I don't believe it...Npc1290:
A chubby, obnoxious kid from some foreign country said something heartrending...
So, I'm healing my wounds in the hot springs.
Hot springs rock!Npc1291:Npc1293:

Npc1294:
Here, the dinosaurs don't come and attack me.  So, I can relax.
...Except now I can't get out.
Without dinosaurs, this place seems like it is missing something big.Npc1295:

However, I heard he's also serving some Giygas guy.Npc0691:
Aren't you the Fly Honey delivery boy?
It doesn't mean I don't trust you.

Someone so quiet is either extremely shy or extremely dangerous...

Earthbound - Full Dialogue Run - Segment 03 (HHV and Runaway 5)

A full dialogue run of Earthbound is one in which every normally-accessible line of overworld and inventory dialogue appears on-screen. “Normally-accessible” means lines of dialogue that are accessible without the use of glitches, cheats, or hacks. Battle-only text such as enemy attacks or in-battle item usages are excluded.

Details

This is a video of segment 03 of the run, comprising Peaceful Rest Valley and Happy Happy Village, through to arrival at Threed.

This is a proof-of-concept recording and makes use of BizHawk features including save states, rapid fire, fast forward, and frame advance for convenience.

I've also written about this run on my blog from various technical, interpretive, and critical perspectives:

This run would be impossible without the years (decades!) of hard work the Earthbound community has undertaken to analyze, hack, and document this remarkable game. In particular, this idea would have been entirely impossible without CoilSnake and CataLatas' earthbound-script-dumper:
